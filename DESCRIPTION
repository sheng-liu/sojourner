Title: Statistical analysis of single molecule trajectories
Version: 1.5.2
Date: 2015-10-15
Description: Single molecule tracking has evolved as a novel new approach complementing genomic sequencing, it reports live biophysical properties of molecules being investigated besides properties relating their coding sequence; here we provided "sojourner" package, to address statistical and bioinformatic needs related to the analysis and comprehension of high throughput single molecule tracking data.
